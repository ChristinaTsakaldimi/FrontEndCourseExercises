        <p>A fingernail is produced by living skin cells in the finger. A fingernail consists of several parts including
            the nail plate which is the visible part of the nail, the <a href="#nailbed">nail bed</a> (the skin beneath
            the nail plate), the <a href="#cuticle">cuticle</a> (the tissue that overlaps the plate and rims the base of
            the nail), the <a href="#folds">nail folds</a> (the skin folds that frame and support the nail on three
            sides), the <a href="#lunula">lunula</a> (the whitish half-moon at the base of the nail) and the<a href="#matrix">
                matrix</a> (the hidden part of the nail unit under the cuticle).</p>
        <h3>Nail Bed</h3>
        <img src="The Front End\HTML & CSS Basics\ASSETS\Humanfingernail.jpg"
            alt="drawing of nailplate, nail bed and bone">
        <p id="nailbed">The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate. Like all skin, it is made of two types of
            tissues: the deeper dermis, the living tissue which includes capillaries and glands, and the epidermis, the
            layer just beneath the nail plate, which moves toward the finger tip with the plate..</p>
        <h3>Cuticle</h3>
        <img src="The Front End\HTML & CSS Basics\ASSETS\cuticle.jpg" alt="photo of nail cuticle">
        <p id="cuticle">The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of almost invisible dead skin cells that "ride out on"
            and cover the back of the visible nail plate while the eponychium is the fold of skin cells that produces
            the cuticle.</p>
        <h3>Nail Folds</h3>
        <img src="The Front End/HTML & CSS Basics/ASSETS/nailfolds.jpg" alt="Drawing of the anatomy of nail folds">
        <p id="folds">The nail folds are soft tissue structures that protect the lateral and proximal edges of the nail
            plate. The proximal nail fold protects most of the nail matrix from trauma and ultraviolet rays.</p>
        <h3>Lunula</h3>
        <img src="The Front End\HTML & CSS Basics\ASSETS\lunula.jpg" alt="Photo of lunula">
        <p id="lunula">The lunula, or lunulae (pl.) (from Latin 'little moon'), is the crescent-shaped whitish area of the bed of a
            fingernail or toenail. The lunula is the visible part of the root of the nail.

            In humans, it appears by week 14 of gestation, and has a primary structural role in defining the free edge
            of the distal nail plate (the part of the nail that grows outward).It is located at the end of the nail
            (that is closest to the skin of the finger), but it still lies under the nail. It is not actually white but
            only appears so when it is seen through the nail. Outlining the nail matrix, the lunula is a very delicate
            part of the nail structure. If one damages the lunula, the nail will be permanently deformed. Even when the
            totality of the nail is removed, the lunula remains in place and is similar in appearance to another smaller
            fingernail embedded in the nail bed.

            In most cases, it is half-moon-shaped and has unique histologic features. Examinations concluded that the
            lunula is an area of loose dermis with lesser developed collagen bundles. It appears whitish because a
            thickened underlying stratum basale obscures the underlying blood vessels.[1]

            The lunula is most noticeable on the thumb; however, not everyone's lunulae are visible. In some cases, the
            eponychium may partially or completely cover the lunula.</p>
        <h3>Matrix</h3>
        <img src="The Front End\HTML & CSS Basics\ASSETS\matrix.jpg" width="90%" alt="picture of nail matrix">
        <p id="matrix">The nail matrix is located deep to the proximal nail fold and nail plate. The proximal nail matrix begins about halfway between the distal interphalangeal joint and the proximal nail fold. The distal nail matrix is visible through the nail plate as a white half-moon structure called the lunula. The nail matrix is responsible for the formation of the hard nail plate and is the only part of the nail unit that contains melanocytes. The nail cells, termed onychocytes, are pushed superficially and distally to form the nail plate. Different parts of the nail matrix form different sections of the nail plate. Generally, the dorsal aspect of the nail plate is formed from the proximal nail matrix, and the ventral nail plate is formed from the distal nail matrix. However, 80% of the nail plate is made from the proximal nail matrix. Therefore, a biopsy or surgery of the distal nail matrix will produce minimal damage to the nail plate.</p>
