            <p>A fingernail is produced by living skin cells in the finger. A fingernail consists of several parts
                including
                the nail plate which is the visible part of the nail, the <a class="link" href="#nailbed">nail bed</a> (the skin
                beneath
                the nail plate), the <a class="link" href="#cuticle">cuticle</a> (the tissue that overlaps the plate and rims the
                base of
                the nail), the <a class="link" href="#folds">nail folds</a> (the skin folds that frame and support the nail on three
                sides), the <a class="link" href="#lunula">lunula</a> (the whitish half-moon at the base of the nail) and the <a class="link" href="#matrix">matrix</a> (the hidden part of the nail unit under the cuticle).</p>

<h3>Nail Bed</h3>
            <section class="info">
            
           <img src="ASSETS/images/Humanfingernail.jpg" alt="drawing of nailplate, nail bed and bone"></div>
            <p id="nailbed">The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate. Like all skin, it is made of two types of
                tissues: the deeper dermis, the living tissue which includes capillaries and glands, and the epidermis,
                the
                layer just beneath the nail plate, which moves toward the finger tip with the plate.</p></div>
        </section>
        <h3>Cuticle</h3>
        <section class="info">
            
            <img src="ASSETS/images/cuticle.jpg" alt="photo of nail cuticle"></div>
            <p id="cuticle">The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of almost invisible dead skin cells that "ride out
                on"
                and cover the back of the visible nail plate while the eponychium is the fold of skin cells that
                produces
                the cuticle.</p>
        </section>
<h3>Nail Folds</h3>
        <section class="info">
            
            <img src="ASSETS/images/nailfolds.jpg" alt="Drawing of the anatomy of nail folds">
            <p id="folds">The nail folds are soft tissue structures that protect the lateral and proximal edges of the
                nail
                plate. The proximal nail fold protects most of the nail matrix from trauma and ultraviolet rays.</p>
        </section>
        <h3>Lunula</h3>
        <section class="info">
            
            <img src="ASSETS/images/lunula.jpg" alt="Photo of lunula">
            <p id="lunula">The lunula, or lunulae (pl.) (from Latin 'little moon'), is the crescent-shaped whitish area
                of
                the bed of a
                fingernail or toenail. The lunula is the visible part of the root of the nail.

                In humans, it appears by week 14 of gestation, and has a primary structural role in defining the free
                edge
                of the distal nail plate (the part of the nail that grows outward).It is located at the end of the nail
                (that is closest to the skin of the finger), but it still lies under the nail. It is not actually white
                but
                only appears so when it is seen through the nail. Outlining the nail matrix, the lunula is a very
                delicate
                part of the nail structure. If one damages the lunula, the nail will be permanently deformed. Even when
                the
                totality of the nail is removed, the lunula remains in place and is similar in appearance to another
                smaller
                fingernail embedded in the nail bed.

                In most cases, it is half-moon-shaped and has unique histologic features. Examinations concluded that
                the
                lunula is an area of loose dermis with lesser developed collagen bundles. It appears whitish because a
                thickened underlying stratum basale obscures the underlying blood vessels.[1]

                The lunula is most noticeable on the thumb; however, not everyone's lunulae are visible. In some cases,
                the
                eponychium may partially or completely cover the lunula.</p>

        <h3>Matrix</h3>
        <section class="info">
            
            <img src="ASSETS/images/matrix.jpg" width="50%" alt="picture of nail matrix">
            <p id="matrix">The nail matrix is located deep to the proximal nail fold and nail plate. The proximal nail
                matrix begins about halfway between the distal interphalangeal joint and the proximal nail fold. The
                distal
                nail matrix is visible through the nail plate as a white half-moon structure called the lunula. The nail
                matrix is responsible for the formation of the hard nail plate and is the only part of the nail unit
                that
                contains melanocytes. The nail cells, termed onychocytes, are pushed superficially and distally to form
                the
                nail plate. Different parts of the nail matrix form different sections of the nail plate. Generally, the
                dorsal aspect of the nail plate is formed from the proximal nail matrix, and the ventral nail plate is
                formed from the distal nail matrix. However, 80% of the nail plate is made from the proximal nail
                matrix.
                Therefore, a biopsy or surgery of the distal nail matrix will produce minimal damage to the nail plate.
